Background

Apollo Client has made GraphQL easy to use. However, there isn’t a go to and stable Chrome developer tool for Apollo Client. 

The only Apollo Client Chrome developer tool we could find was the created by the Apollo team back in 2017 that’s received limited maintenance since. Their tool, though feature rich, struggles with the initial recognition of Apollo instances on web apps today and as a result has received a lot of criticism in the reviews for the tool.

So, the goal of ApolloDevQL was to make a stable and easy to use Apollo Client Chrome Developer tool. 

ApolloDevQL always renders in its Chrome Panel. If the Apollo instance is not found, the developer gets clear feedback. Beyond having an easy initial set up, ApolloDevQL allows the developer to send requests to a GraphQL endpoint via GraphiQL, dig into the details of an web apps queries, mutations, cache and understand performance of your GraphQL API’s resolvers.
